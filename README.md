# Password Generator

## Description
The goal of this project was to take starter code for a password generating website, and turn it into a functioning password generator using javascript.

## Key Points
1. Added a clickable "Generate Password" button to start the password creation process
2. Created a series of user prompts so they could select their password criteria
3. Created a prompt to determine the character length of the password
4. Created code in js to validate and use the criteria that the user is looking for
5. When all prompts are answered, the generated password matches the selection criteria
6. The password is then written to the page for the user to see
